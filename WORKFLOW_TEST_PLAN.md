# Workflow Test Plan

## Current Situation

**Commits:**
- `f5fd5d9` - Your workflow fixes + trigger file
- `8733400` - Chart build commit (created by CI)

**What Happened:**
1. ✅ `harbor-build-chart.yml` ran on `f5fd5d9` and created commit `8733400`
2. ❌ `helmbuild.yml` ran on `f5fd5d9` but skipped because no chart changes in that commit
3. ❌ `helmbuild.yml` did NOT run on `8733400` (the chart commit)

## Why It Failed

The workflow was triggered by `f5fd5d9`, but the chart changes are in `8733400`. The `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` check was looking at the wrong commit.

## The Fix

Using `dorny/paths-filter@v3` action which properly detects path changes in the **current push event**, not just comparing HEAD~1 vs HEAD.

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Trigger a New Build (Recommended)

```bash
# Make a trivial change to trigger the build workflow
echo "2" > harbor-automated/modifications/trigger-build
git add harbor-automated/modifications/trigger-build
git commit -m "test: trigger Harbor chart build to test CI pipeline"
git push origin main
```

**Expected Results:**
1. `harbor-build-chart.yml` runs → builds chart → commits to `harbor-helm/`
2. `helmbuild.yml` runs on the NEW commit → detects `harbor-helm/` changes → publishes chart ✅

### Option 2: Manual Workflow Dispatch

If `harbor-build-chart.yml` supports `workflow_dispatch`, you can manually trigger it from GitHub Actions UI.

### Option 3: Verify with Chart Changes

```bash
# Make a direct change to the chart (for testing only)
cd harbor-automated/harbor-helm
# Make a small change to Chart.yaml
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify helmbuild.yml detects chart changes"
git push origin main
```

**Expected Results:**
- `helmbuild.yml` runs → `detect-changes` job detects changes → `build-harbor-automated` publishes ✅

## What to Look For

### In `harbor-build-chart.yml` logs:
```
✅ Chart built and committed to repository
Next: Stage 2 CI will publish this chart to registry
```

### In `helmbuild.yml` logs:
```
detect-changes job:
  ✅ harbor: true

build-harbor-automated job:
  ✅ Running (not skipped)
  ✅ Publishing chart to registry
```

## Rollback Plan

If the fix doesn't work, you can:
1. Revert the changes to `helmbuild.yml`
2. Use a simpler approach: Remove the conditional entirely and always publish all charts
3. Or use separate workflows for each chart with path filters in the `on:` trigger

## Notes

- The `paths-filter` action is widely used and battle-tested
- It properly handles GitHub's push event context
- The loop prevention in `harbor-build-chart.yml` ensures no infinite loops
