# CI Workflow Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The `helmbuild.yml` workflow's `build-harbor-automated` job was **NOT triggered** after the chart was built by `harbor-build-chart.yml`.

### Root Causes:

1. **`[skip ci]` in commit message** - The `harbor-build-chart.yml` workflow added `[skip ci]` to the commit message, which prevented ALL workflows from running on that commit.

2. **Broken conditional check** - Line 135 in `helmbuild.yml` used:
   ```yaml
   if: contains(github.event.head_commit.modified, 'harbor-automated/harbor-helm/')
   ```
   This was checking a non-existent property and would never evaluate correctly.

## Changes Made

### 1. `harbor-build-chart.yml` (Stage 1 - Build)
- **Removed `[skip ci]`** from the commit message (line 126)
- **Added loop prevention** to avoid infinite workflow triggers:
  - Skip if triggered by `github-actions[bot]`
  - Skip if commit message contains `'chore: build Harbor chart'`

### 2. `helmbuild.yml` (Stage 2 - Publish) - **FINAL FIX**
- **Added path filters to the `on.push` trigger**:
  - Workflow only triggers when chart directories change
  - Includes all chart paths: `ecr-regcred/**`, `reliza-cd/**`, etc.
  - Most importantly: `harbor-automated/harbor-helm/**`
- **Removed complex conditional logic**:
  - No need for `detect-changes` job
  - No need for `paths-filter` action
  - GitHub's native path filtering handles it
- **Added explicit branch specification** to push trigger

### Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work

**Attempt 1:** `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD`
- Workflow triggered on commit `9190323` (source changes)
- Checked if `harbor-helm/` changed in that commit → **NO**
- Chart changes were in commit `f0fc84b` (created later by CI)

**Attempt 2:** `dorny/paths-filter@v3` action
- Same timing issue - workflow runs before chart commit exists
- Even with `fetch-depth: 0`, it compares wrong commits

**Solution:** Workflow-level path filters
- Workflow **only triggers** when specified paths change
- When `9190323` is pushed → no `harbor-helm/` changes → workflow doesn't run
- When `f0fc84b` is pushed → `harbor-helm/` changes → workflow runs ✅

## Workflow Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Developer pushes changes to harbor-automated/cmd/**         │
│ or harbor-automated/modifications/**                        │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ harbor-build-chart.yml (Stage 1)                            │
│ - Builds Go tool                                            │
│ - Generates Harbor chart                                    │
│ - Commits to harbor-automated/harbor-helm/                  │
│ - Does NOT add [skip ci]                                    │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ helmbuild.yml (Stage 2) - Triggered ONLY if                 │
│ harbor-automated/harbor-helm/** changed in the commit       │
│ → build-harbor-automated job runs                           │
│ → Publishes chart to registry via reliza-helm-action        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Make a change to any file in `harbor-automated/cmd/` or `harbor-automated/modifications/`
2. Push to main branch
3. Verify that:
   - `harbor-build-chart.yml` runs and commits the chart
   - `helmbuild.yml` is triggered by that commit
   - `build-harbor-automated` job runs and publishes the chart

## Notes

- The loop prevention ensures that when `helmbuild.yml` runs, it won't trigger `harbor-build-chart.yml` again
- Both workflows now work together as a proper two-stage pipeline
- The `build-harbor-automated` job will only run when the chart actually changes
